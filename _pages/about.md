# Hi, I'm Nicholas Vandra

I’m an **aspiring Machine Learning Engineer** and current **Data Science graduate student**, driven by a passion for **deep learning**, **neural networks**, and especially **audio-based AI models**. My work focuses on building next-generation systems that go beyond traditional text-centric models — including **audio transformers**, multi-headed decoders, and hybrid CNN/RNN architectures.

My technical experience includes:

- Neural networks & deep learning  
- Machine learning pipelines  
- Transformer architectures  
- Distributed computing & cloud engineering  
- Software engineering in Python, Java, and C++  
- Data engineering, preprocessing & feature extraction  
- GPU-accelerated model training and optimization

## Education

**M.S. in Data Science**  
*Southern Methodist University*

**B.S. in Computer Science**  
*California State University, Monterey Bay*

## Research Interests

- Large-scale audio modeling  
- Raw-audio neural networks  
- Transformer encoder/decoder architectures  
- Speech-based sentiment analysis  
- Multimodal learning (audio → text)  
- Deep learning optimization & GPU efficiency

## What I’m Working On

I’m currently developing a **new type of audio transformer architecture**, where:

- A hybrid **CNN + BiLSTM** model extracts spectral and temporal features  
- A transformer encoder learns long-range structure  
- Multiple decoders handle **speech recognition**, **sentiment analysis**, and **text generation**  
- A final multi-headed decoder merges outputs into a unified prediction  

This ongoing research project aims to push the boundaries of audio-focused machine learning.
